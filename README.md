# clicky-game

This Simpson Clicky-Game is a game of memory!  Click one picture at a time, clicking all of the pictures but never double clicking the same picture or you will fail!  The game continues until you have successfully clicked all of the pictures on the screen one time.  The order of the pictures changes with each click, which is where the difficulty of the game comes into play!

Go ahead and give it a try for yourself!
